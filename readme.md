# Teach Yourself, Teach Us
### Document it

Python has always been interesting to me given my desire to work with data, so I'd been self teaching outside the scope of class. I figured today was a good opportunity to get up and running with Django, which is a common Python framework for web applications.

It's 1:56 and this is due at 2, so I'll get the rest of this done later. If interested, checkout https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial01/ and jump right in.
